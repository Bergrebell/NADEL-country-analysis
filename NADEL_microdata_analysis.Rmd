# 1. Introduction
<!-- Write an introduction including some background on the problem and also on your country. -->

\newpage
# 2. Analysis
<!-- Explain the main empirical approach of your analysis to investigate the research question (regression
model, dependent and independent variables). -->

\newpage
# 3. Results
## 3.1 Presentation
<!-- Present the results: descriptive statistics (e.g. tables and or graphs) and regression results. 
source: https://www.econometrics-with-r.org/11-1-binary-dependent-variables-and-the-linear-probability-model.html
-->
First impressions:
```{r, out.width="50%", fig.cap="Stunting", fig.align = 'center'}
model1 <- lm(stunting ~ log_y)
plot(stunting ~ log_y)
abline(model1, col="blue")
```

```{r, out.width="50%", fig.cap="Dead at Age of 5", fig.align = 'center'}
model2 <- lm(dead5 ~ log_y)
plot(dead5 ~ log_y)
abline(model2, col="blue")
```

Don't use this - just to give a hint of correlating variables
```{r, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Dead at Age of 5", fig.align = 'center'}
#corr=cor(dataset[as.numeric(which(sapply(dataset,class)=="numeric"))])
#chart.Correlation(corr)
```



## 3.2 Discussion
<!-- Explain and discuss the results. -->

\newpage
# 4. Conclusion
<!-- Provide a conclusion and some discussion on the limitation of your study as well as policy implications -->
